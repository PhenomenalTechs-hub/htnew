                Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values,
                beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and
                directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners
                can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience
                that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The
                methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for
                India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should
                quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars,
                unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country
                like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education(
                somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….

                We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a
                21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…

                For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuff from the syllabus, which
                almost 90% is irrelevant and students actually forget sooner or later and should be replaced with a
                practical and solution-centric approach to studies which will develop thinkers and leaders of tomorrow.

                Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary
                in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation.
                Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to
                extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education
                developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.

                Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe. The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European
                civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.
